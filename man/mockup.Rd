\title{Create a mockup dataset using numeric patterns}
\usage{
mockup(data, patterns)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame or tibble.}

\item{patterns}{A named list of patterns, where each name corresponds to a column in the dataset.
Patterns can be a single pattern (applied to all rows) or a vector with the same length as the column.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the same structure as `data` but with numeric values masked according to the patterns.
}
\description{
Generates a dataset where numeric values are replaced with masked representations
based on specified patterns for each column. Useful for creating anonymized examples or mock datasets.
}
\examples{
df <- tibble::tibble(
  stat = c("10 (50.0\%)", "23 (45.0\%)", "50 (90.1\%)"),
  mean_sd = c("23.5 (2.1)", "10.4 (3.2)", "12.0 (4.1)")
)
mockup(df, patterns = list(
  stat = "i(2)+f(2,1,.)",
  mean_sd = "f(2,1,.)+f(1,1,.)"
))
