\title{Derive or Update Variables in an ADaM Dataset with Complex Conditions}
\usage{
derive(
  .data,
  var,
  main,
  from = list(),
  cases = list(),
  by = "USUBJID",
  default = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame (primary dataset) where the variable will be derived or updated.}

\item{var}{Symbol or string. Name of the variable to be derived or updated in `.data`.}

\item{main}{String. Name of the primary dataset within the `from` list (usually `.data` name).}

\item{from}{Named list of data frames. Auxiliary datasets used in conditional expressions.
Each dataset must be named, e.g., `list(ADPD = adpd_df, ADIS = adis_df)`.}

\item{cases}{List of lists. Each inner list must have two elements: `condition` and `value`.
- `condition`: an expression evaluated within the environment containing `.data` and `from` datasets. Use `derive_expr()` to encapsulate the condition.
- `value`: expression or constant to assign to `var` when `condition` is TRUE.  Use `derive_expr()` to encapsulate the condition.
The conditions are evaluated in order; the first matching case has precedence.}

\item{by}{String. The subject identifier variable name common to `.data` and all datasets in `from`.
Used to match rows across datasets (default is `"USUBJID"`).}

\item{default}{Value or expression assigned to `var` for rows where no `cases` condition matches. Use `derive_expr()` to encapsulate the condition.
Defaults to `NA`.}
}
\value{
The original dataset `.data` with the variable `var` derived or updated accordingly.
}
\description{
This function derives or updates a variable in a primary dataset (e.g., ADSL) based on
complex conditions involving multiple auxiliary datasets. It supports multiple conditional
assignments and a default value.
